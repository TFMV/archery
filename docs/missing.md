# Missing Compute Functions

The following Arrow compute functions were unavailable in github.com/apache/arrow-go/v18 v18.3.0 and are implemented manually in Archery:

- `mean`
- `variance`
- `stddev`
- `count`
- `any`
- `all`

These functions should be replaced with native compute equivalents when they become available.
